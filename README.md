# Apache Atlas docs


In this repository, we will put various doc, template, code to play with an Apache Atlas instance.

To deploy the Atlas server, we will have two modes:
- standalone: classic bare metal install
- k8s/docker: build a docker image, deploy it on a docker or k8s cluster 

After that, we will learn some basic api to load data into Atlas server

## Standalone installation

## Build the docker image

## Run the docker image via docker ce

## Run the docker image via k8s cluster

## Rest api example

In rest_api example, we use atlas rest api to 
- search entities: more detailed document about search entities  can be found [here](doc/rest_api/README.md)
- load entities: The sop and example of finding entity template can be found [here](doc/rest_api/entity_management/README.md)
